### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for stopping by. I'm Scott. Just a littlebit about me.... I was a bit of an indie dev back in the days (well before the days of Github!). mostly freelancing on the symbian os scene.

If you had a Nokia handheld in the early 2000s chances are that you were using something thaat I'd worked on, be it a game from Gameloft (remember them and their reign of terror?) or an app (email, calenders etc) and maybe even the occasional bluetooth worm shshshs...

After over almost two decades away from programming ; and two other careers in carpentry and stage design that took me around the world .. thought I'd give the old coding another crack. Luckily now I can do it as a retired hobbydev. Still a lot to catchup on =)

Pleasure to be here. Get in touch if you have an interesting project or two in mind.
